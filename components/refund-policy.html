            # No Refund Policy

**Last Updated: April 30, 2025**

## Introduction

This No Refund Policy outlines the terms and conditions regarding payments made to NextStep Educational Services ("we," "our," or "us") for premium services offered on our website (nextstepedu.co.in). We ask that you read this policy carefully before making any purchases.

By purchasing our premium services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this No Refund Policy.

## Premium Service Purchases

### Subscription Types

We offer the following premium subscription options:
- **Premium Plan**: One-time payment for 1-month access to premium features
- **Redemption Code Access**: Variable duration based on the specific code

### Payment Processing

All payments are processed securely through our payment partner, Razorpay. Payments are subject to the terms and conditions of Razorpay in addition to this policy.

## No Refund Policy

### Non-Refundable Purchases

All payments made for premium services on NextStep Educational Services are **non-refundable** under any circumstances, including but not limited to:

1. **Dissatisfaction with Services**: We encourage you to review our free features and demos before making a purchase decision. Once payment is made, no refunds will be issued if you are dissatisfied with our premium features.

2. **Change of Mind**: We do not offer refunds if you change your mind about needing our services after purchase.

3. **Unused Services**: No refunds will be provided for unused portions of your premium access period, regardless of usage level.

4. **Redemption Codes**: Premium access acquired through redemption codes is strictly non-refundable.

5. **Account Termination**: If your account is terminated for any reason, including violation of our Terms and Conditions, no refund will be provided.

### Exceptions to No Refund Policy

Despite our strict No Refund Policy, we may consider exceptions in the following extremely limited circumstances, at our sole discretion:

1. **Fraudulent Charges**: If unauthorized charges are made to your payment method, please contact your bank or payment provider immediately to dispute the charge, and notify us at nextstep.india1@gmail.com.

2. **Duplicate Payments**: If our system erroneously charges you multiple times for the same purchase, the duplicate charges may be refunded upon verification.

3. **Service Not Provided**: If you have paid for a specific premium feature that is permanently unavailable due to technical issues on our platform (not related to your device, browser, or internet connection), we may consider a partial refund proportionate to the unavailable feature.

## Cancellation Policy

### Subscription Cancellation

- Premium access purchases are one-time payments for a fixed duration (1 year or 2 years) and do not automatically renew.
- You may choose to discontinue using our premium services at any time, but no refunds will be issued for unused portions of your premium access period.
- To formally cancel your premium access, please email us at nextstep.india1@gmail.com with your registered email address and the subject line "Premium Access Cancellation."

### Account Cancellation

- You may request to cancel your NextStep account at any time by emailing nextstep.india1@gmail.com.
- Account cancellation will result in the termination of any associated premium access without any refund.

## Technical Issues

If you encounter technical issues that impact your ability to use our premium services:

1. Contact our support team immediately at nextstep.india1@gmail.com or via WhatsApp at +91 9420444009.
2. Provide detailed information about the issue, including screenshots and steps to reproduce the problem.
3. Our team will work diligently to resolve any technical issues as quickly as possible.

However, technical issues do not qualify for refunds under our policy.

## Pre-Purchase Considerations

Before making a purchase, we strongly encourage you to:

1. **Try Our Free Features**: Familiarize yourself with our platform using free features.
2. **Review Documentation**: Read through our feature descriptions and documentation.
3. **Contact Support**: If you have questions about specific features, contact our support team before purchase.
4. **Check Compatibility**: Ensure our services are compatible with your devices and internet connection.

## Chargebacks

Initiating unauthorized chargebacks through your bank or payment provider is considered a violation of this policy and our Terms and Conditions. Unauthorized chargebacks may result in:

1. Immediate termination of your account
2. Permanent loss of access to all services
3. Possible legal action to recover funds and associated fees

We strongly encourage you to contact us directly to resolve any issues before initiating a chargeback.
